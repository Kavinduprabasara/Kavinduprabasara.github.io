    "subtitle": "Jul 2022 - Aug 2023",
    "description": "As part of a first-year hardware project, we developed an automated water recycling system using the Arduino Uno R3. The system was designed to efficiently recycle and monitor water quality. We created a 3D model and simulation using Blender, which helped in visualizing the design. The PCB was custom-designed using EasyEDA and then assembled to bring the system to life. Key components used included water pumps for water circulation, relays for automation control, servo motors and stepper motors for mechanical movements, and sensors such as pH and turbidity sensors for real-time water quality monitoring. The project successfully demonstrated a working, automated water recycling process.",
    "details": "This hardware project was an excellent opportunity to work with physical computing. I programmed the Arduino Uno to read sensor data and control the actuators. The 3D modeling in Blender allowed us to iterate on the physical design before fabrication. The custom PCB design reduced wiring clutter and improved reliability.",
